# MoneyLeft program

A portfolio project to calculate survival time based on money remaining in bank accounts, as well as money spent per month.

The program uses US tax rules, and is not intended to be a serious financial tool, but to provide a general rundown.

## To run

First, rename `accounts.yaml.default` to `accounts.yaml` and add desired information.  Install go if you haven't, then run `go run main.go`.

## Testing

Run `go test ./...`
